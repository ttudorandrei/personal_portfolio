# Title

Personal Portfolio

## Description

As a developer I have built my Portfolio landing page.

- The page contains a navigation bar with clickable links towards certain sections of the page.
- The About Me sections contains a profile picture and a short description.
- The profile photo changes shape and color when hovered on with the mouse.
- After the About Me section there is a Contact section. The logos are linked to their respective websites or contact info.
- Portfolio section contains images and description of completed projects.
- Every image rescales, changes colour and gets a border when hovered on with the mouse.
- Every image is clickable and linked to that respective project.
- The landing page is responsive and adapts and reorders its content based on the size of the viewport.
